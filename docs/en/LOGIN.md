# Simulated login


## Login class
For users who only want to simply get the login-in session, it is recommended to use the Login class object provided by the DecryptLogin library.
Specifically, here is an example:
```python
from DecryptLogin import login

# the instanced Login class object
lg = login.Login()
# use the provided api function to login in the target website (e.g. twitter)
infos_return, session = lg.twitter(username='Your Username', password='Your Password')
```
All the api functions for logining in the corresponding websites support the following arguments:
```
username: the username for login in the target website
password: the password for login in the target website
mode: pc/mobile, using the default setting is recommended
crackvcFunc: a user-defined captcha identification function, the input of this function is the image path of captcha and it should return the recognition result of captcha
proxies: use proxies during the simulated login, the supported formats of proxies is the same as https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/advanced/#proxies
```


## Loginer class
The DecryptLogin library also supports returning the instantiated simulated login class of the corresponding website before implementing the simulated login. 
Specifically, the code could be implemented as follows:
```python
from DecryptLogin import login

# the instanced Loginer class object
loginer = login.Loginer()
# obtain the simulated login class of the corresponding website (e.g. twitter)
twitter_loginer = loginer.twitter()
# call login function to achieve simulated login
infos_return, session = twitter_loginer.login(username='Your Username', password='Your Password')
```
The arguments supported by the login function are the same as those used to implement simulated login support using the Login class object.
The advantage of this scheme is that it is easier to call other useful functions in this class in order to achieve functions other than simulated login.
